## ðŸ“ž **Questions for Clarification**

1. **Voice Provider**: Prefer Whisper or Deepgram for STT?
2. **Vector Database**: Which provider - Pinecone, Weaviate, or sqlite-vss?
3. **Design System**: Should we migrate to the exact glassmorphism tokens (24/16/10px radius)?
4. **Telegram Integration**: Specific chat whitelist IDs?
5. **Feature Flags**: Prefer LaunchDarkly, Split.io, or custom solution?
